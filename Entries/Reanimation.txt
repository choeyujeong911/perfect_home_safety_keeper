DESCRIPTION:
Reanimations are any deceased remains of living creatures capable of moving on their own.
Homeowners with Reanimations commonly report foul smells, soil being tracked inside the home, and large holes in the ground appearing near or around the home.

DANGER:
Reanimations are capable of spreading a wide variety of dangerous diseases and parasites deadly to humans, so close proximity or contact should be avoided at all costs.
They are also commonly used to inflict direct violence against homeowners, and are incredibly adept at hiding and waiting for vulnerable moments.

SOLUTION:
Reanimations' pursuit is slow but relentless, so relocation is not necessary or advisable.
It is advised to contact any friends, neighbors or strangers the homeowner may have recently slighted, and make peace or bargain.
