DESCRIPTION:
Troll are giant, 12 ft tall nocturnal creatures that normally are not seen in the home.
However, during the winter they will deflate their bodies in order to fit inside homes and steal warm materials such as blankets or articles of clothing.
Homeowners infested with a Troll will frequently report missing clothes, or claim to hear the shrill sounds of air escaping in the middle of the night.

DANGER:
Trolls are very dangerous to humans when they are startled, thanks to their ability to inflate their bodies to their full height of 12 feet in a matter of seconds.
Their skin, despite its flexibility, is incredibly durable and will smash through the ceilings of most homes when fully inflated, causing property damage and injury to anyone in the vicinity.
Do not ever approach a Troll.

SOLUTION:
An active Troll will leave by morning once it has secured its bounty.
It is recommended to install repelling fixtures such as UV lights to prevent future break-ins.
