DESCRIPTION:
The Horde is an invisible, odorless collective consciousness that is known to collect and store large quantities of common household refuse.
[설명]


DANGER:
The Horde's tendency to store vast quantities of trash in the home make them prone to spreading disease to the home's inhabitants.
Rotten food, used syringes, and rusty metal are among the more common household hazards that can be introduced by The Horde's presence.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
Once introduced to a home, The Horde will continue to gather and horde their treasures indefinitely.
It is advised to sell one's home at the first sign of The Horde's presence to make the relocation process go over more smoothly.
To prevent The Horde from gathering in one's home, it is advised to keep one's home as tidy as possible as to not attract The Horde's attention.
The introduction of a Hobb to the household can often assist in this process.
