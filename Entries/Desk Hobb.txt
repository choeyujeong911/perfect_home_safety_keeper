DESCRIPTION:
Desk Hobbs are a subspecies of Hobb that are known to inhabit desks, vanities and other similar structures.
They regularly like to tidy their homes, and will frequently sort and order materials in the desk to their liking.
They are physically similar to other Hobbs, but are generally much smaller and have raspy, loose hair.
They do not bear a false face.

DANGER:
Desk Hobbs are not dangerous to humans if left unprovoked.
Like any other Hobb, they are also capable of metamorphosing.

SOLUTION:
Desk Hobbs cannot be removed once they nest.
To prevent further danger, measures to prevent metamorphosis should be taken as soon as possible.
It is advised to leave bread crumbs on the desk each night before going to bed.
