DANGER:
Termites are harmless to humans by themselves, but the damage they can cause to a house's structural integrity can be deadly long-term, and should be removed as soon as possible.

SOLUTION:
Termites can be removed using common pesticides, but the treatment must be thorough and destroy the entire colony.
Otherwise, they will quickly repopulate and resume their activity.
It is highly advised to utilize HSH's Professional Termite Removal services.
