DESCRIPTION:
Animations are any miniature humanoid figure such as dolls, puppets or marionettes that are capable of moving on their own.
Homeowners with Animations most commonly report hearing clattering noises at night, and missing or stolen household objects.
[설명]


DANGER:
Animations are usually not directly dangerous to humans, and will ignore them entirely as they go about their business.
But their presence in a household may indicate the interest of other potentially dangerous parties.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
Most Animations will depart or collapse on their own after completing their intended function, and no further action if needed.
If an Animation persists for more than a few days in a single location, it may be a sign of more dangerous activity.
In these cases, it is advised to contact HSH's Pest Removal Services.
