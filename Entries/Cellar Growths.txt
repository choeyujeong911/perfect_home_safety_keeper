DANGER:
As Cellar Growths most commonly grow on ceilings, their weight can often cause duress to a home's foundation, and as such their removal should be prioritized.
The slimy residue they drip onto the floor can also be toxic to small mammals or human children.

SOLUTION:
When in their infancy, Cellar Growths can be easily scraped off and the affected area should be sanitized to prevent further growths.
If a Cellar Growth starts glowing or pulsating, it is no longer safe to remove in this manner, and it is highly advised to utilize HSH's Fungal Removal services.
