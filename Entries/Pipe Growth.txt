DESCRIPTION:
Pipe Growths are a type of fungus that are known for making homes inside damp, tube-like structures such as pipes.
Pipe Growths often grow slightly larger than the pipes they inhabit, and will therefore clog the pipe indefinitely until their removal.
Pipe Growths are known to make loud bubbling digestion noises after they eat a full meal.

They are otherwise harmless to humans.

SOLUTION:
To remove a Pipe Growth from its home it must be offered a replacement.
Any common PCP pipe will suffice.
One should garnish the inside of the replacement home with anassorment of meat juices and insects.
Place the replacement home near one of the pipe's openings and leave it overnight.
The following day the Pipe Growth should be moved into its new home, where it can then be safely relocated away from the household.
