DANGER:
Kobolds are harmless to human until they are discovered, at which point they will often lash out violently to protect their home, causing injury or even death.
If discovered, Kobolds will attempt to lure humans into their space by poking their dog-like heads out from behind corners and whimpering.
Do not ever enter a Kobold's domain.
