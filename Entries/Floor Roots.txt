[설명]


DANGER:
Floor Roots grow slow enough that they serve very little danger to awake and aware human adults.
However, if not spotted quickly they are a known strangling hazard for human children and pets while they sleep.
Removal should be a priority in family households.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
Floor Roots require something to wrap around before they will cease their growth, so it is advised to acquire dolls, or a similar human-shaped facsimile to give them a safer alternative.
Place the dolls in the affected room and leave the roots alone for the night.
By morning, the dools and roots should be gone, and the room safe to inhabit once more.
Make any repairs to the floor as needed, or utilize HSH's Home Repair services.
