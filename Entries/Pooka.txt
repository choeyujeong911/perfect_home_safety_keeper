DESCRIPTION:
Pookas are shapeless creatures that commonly inhabit homes in the shape and likeness of a household pet.
They are known for their tendency to replace common pets such as dogs or cats, and live in their place to watch homeowners eat and sleep.
Homeowners with Pookas frequently report unusual or frightening pet behavior.

DANGER:
Pookas are relatively harmless to humans, but the discarded bodies of household pets they leave behind can over time create other pest and disease hazards within the home.
A foul smell signifies decay, and the discarded body should be found and removed immediately.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
Pookas can be discouraged to leave a home by not drawing attention to their activities.
Pookas thrive on the attention they receive from frightened homeowners, so refrain from screaming or yelling when surprised by them, and make attempts to ignore their presence whenever possible.
