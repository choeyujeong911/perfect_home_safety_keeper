DESCRIPTION:
Spring Vines are rapidly growing vines that are known to quickly consume a house and block off exits.
They are often a sign that a Spriggan has been provoked.
[설명]


DANGER:
Spring Vines are not dangerous on their own, and can be cut through with common gardening tools.
However, their tendency to block exits can create struggles when needing to exit the house in a hurry, such in the case of floods, fires, or a Spriggan in pursuit.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
Spring Vines will continue to grow so long as the Spriggan that made them desires it.
It is advised to vacate and re-home as soon as possible.
