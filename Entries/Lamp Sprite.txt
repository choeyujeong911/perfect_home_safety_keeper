DESCRIPTION:
Lamp Sprites are a common subspecies of Sprite that make their homes inside lamp fixtures.
They are known for causing the lamps they inhabit to flicker or burn hotter, sometimes causing a burning smell in the home.
[설명]


DANGER:
Lamp Sprites are not dangerous to humans unless provoked.
Do not, under any circumstances, turn off the lamp or attempt to reach your hand inside the lamp when actively inhabited.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
Lamp Sprites will leave on their own once their lamp of choice goes out on its own.
At this point, they will attempt to seek out a new lamp.
To prevent a Lamp Sprite from re-homing itself, ensure all household lamps are turned off until the expiration period.
When the Lamp Sprite fails to find an active lamp, it will leave the home on its own.
