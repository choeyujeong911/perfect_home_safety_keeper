DESCRIPTION:
Night Gnomes are small, hairy creatures with a pointed head.
They are known for their tendency to enter the sleeping quarters of humans to watch them while they sleep.
Homeowners affected by Night Gnomes frequently report sighting them in the middle of the night, or report heavy breathing sounds during late hours.

DANGER:
Night Gnomes are not known to be deadly to humans, but those who suffer from heart conditions should consider wearing sleeping masks to prevent being startled by their presence.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
Night Gnomes will move on to other homes if they become bored or restless by your inhabitants' sleeping activites.
There is no guarantee, however, that they will become bored by you if they find your sleep sufficiently entertaining.
