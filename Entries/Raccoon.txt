DESCRIPTION:
Raccoons are small nocturnal mammals with grey and brown fur known for their tendency to rummage through garbage cans or nest in attics.
Homeowners infested with Raccoons often report frequent garbage spills, or clattering sounds at night.

DANGER:
Raccoons are capable of biting humans and spreading deadly diseases such as rabies, so caution around them is advised.
Additionally, their feces can contain deadly parasites which, if accidentally inhaled or ingested, can cause progressive neurogical damage to humans, or eventual death.

SOLUTION:
Raccoons are quite intelligent, and are thus quite tricky to remove from a home safety.
Preventative measures include securing trash cans, and blocking any potential outdoor access to attics.
It is highly advised to utilize HSH's Pest Removal Service.
