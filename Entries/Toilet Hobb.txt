DESCRIPTION:
Toilet Hobbs are a subspecies of Hobb that are known for homing inside toilets.
They bear false faces, and have two separate clumps of wispy hair on each side of their heads.
Like most Hobbs, they tend to clean their homes when they are active at night, keeping the toilet they inhabit nearly spotless.

DANGER:
Toilet Hobbs are not dangerous on their own, but their physical presence within the toilet they inhabit may result in plumbing problems over time such as leaks or clogs.
Like any other Hobb, they are also capable of metamorphosing.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
Toilet Hobbs cannot be removed once they nest.
To prevent further danger, measures to prevent metamorphosis should be taken as soon as possible.
It is advised to leave an egg near the toilet each night before going to bed.
