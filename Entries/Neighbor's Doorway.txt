DESCRIPTION:
Neighbor's Doorways are door frame-like structures that can often appear in basements or cellars.
They are known to cause confusion if stepped through, as well as parallelism.
[설명]


DANGER:
Neighbor's Doorways do not cause any direct harm to humans, but if stepped through, the resulting parallelism will often result in unwanted household activity such as altered behavior or perceived missing memories in the human who comes through the other side.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
Neighbor's Doorways are tricky to remove without accidentally putting one's body through them and potentially triggering the parallel activity.
It is advised to utilize HSH's Doorway Removal Services.
One can prevent Neighbor's Doorways from occurring by practicing mindfulness and not letting one's mind wander towards wishing for alternate life paths.
