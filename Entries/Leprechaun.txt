DANGER:
In addition to being a household nuisance, Leprechauns' appetite for precious metals can also cause long-term damage to heaters, furnaces, and other common appliances if they are not properly protected.
Additionally, Leprechauns can occasionally cause direct harm to humans in cases where homeowners have metallic medical implants such as braces, crowns, or joint replacements.

SOLUTION:
Leprechauns will move on to other feeding grounds on their own once they run out of food, but more proactive means of removal require physical capture.
If immediate removal is desired, It is recommended to utilize professional help via HSH's Pest Control Services.
