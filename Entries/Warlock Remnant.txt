DESCRIPTION:
Varlock Remnants are a residual presence often left behind by former Warlocks, most commonly inhabiting older households, castles, or underground dwellings.
Homeowners experiencing Warlock Remnants often report objects moving on their own, the sound of hostile warning whispers, or sighting bearded figures in reflective surfaces.

DANGER:
Warlock Remnants, while a hostile presence, are mere echoes of their former selves, and are generally harmless.
Their ability to manipulate small household objects can prove hazardous to less cautious homeowners, however.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
Homeowners can purge the remnant from their home with the use of a Seelie Stone, but the journey to retrieve one is both long and perilous, and not recommended.
If a Warlock Remnant proves sufficiently hazardous or inconvenient, it is highly recommended for homeowners to simply relocate.
