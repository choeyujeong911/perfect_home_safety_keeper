DESCRIPTION:
Mirror Nymphs are a subspecies of Nymph that are known for stealing the likeness of homeowners and passerbys.
They are generally small, faceless and voiceless humanoids carrying a large mirror that they beckon others to look into.
Homeowners afflicted by Mirror Nymphs commonly report not being able to recognize their own face.

DANGER:

SOLUTION:
Mirror Nymphs will wander to different locations provided nobody looks into their mirror.
Affected homeowners can restore their likeness by catching the Mirror Nymph and breaking its mirror with an iron implement.
