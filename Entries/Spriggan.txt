DESCRIPTION:
Spriggans are small green humanoids with leaf-like coatings on their bodies.
They are seen rarely in households and reside primarily inside trees.
They are known to act violently upon homeowners when provoked, however.
Homeowners affected by Spriggans commonly report rapid vine growth in and around their homes, and the feeling that the trees are watching them.

DANGER:
Spriggans are incredibly dangerous to humans when provoked, and physical contact with one will result in the growth of a Sprig Tree within the affected individual.

SOLUTION:
Spriggans cannot be persuaded to leave the home once provoked, however one can take precautions to prevent provoking a Spriggan.
Refrain from removing trees, flowers, or weeds on your property.
Do not ever kill or hunt wildlife within view of your home.
Do not eat any wild fruit or vegetable that may grow on your property.
Consider making offers of water each night, left in a clean dish on your porch.
