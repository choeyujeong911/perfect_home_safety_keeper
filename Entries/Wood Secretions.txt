DANGER:
Wood Secretions can be deadly to humans, causing a rapid translation of fresh if ingested.
Keep animals and human children away from secretions at all costs, as its foul odor will be interpreted as a sweet, candy-like smell to them, making them particularly susceptible to accidental ingestion.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
Once started, wood secretions will continue indefinitely.
To remove the hazard from a home, the offending wood should be replaced entirely.
To prevent wood from entering the secretion stage, ensure good care is taken towards wood in the home, and refrain from scratching, knocking, or banging on wooden surfaces.
Do not ever insult or shout at wood.
