DESCRIPTION:
Mice are small worthless rodents commonly found in the household.
Homeowners with a mice infestation commonly report gnaw marks, small round droppings, and sounds of squeaking.

DANGER:
Mice are capable of carrying any number of diseases, so they serve as an indirect danger to most humans and should be dealt with immediately.

SOLUTION:
Common removal methods for mice include the use of pesticides, the introduction of a house cat to the household, and various kinds of bait traps.
These can prove effective for small populations.
Large mice infestations should be dealt with using HSH's Pest Removal Service.
