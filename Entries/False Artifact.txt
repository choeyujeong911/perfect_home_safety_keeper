DESCRIPTION:
False Artifacts are seemingly human-designed objects that can manifest suddenly inside a home.
They are known for making gentle buzzing sounds that can usually only be heard by very young human children or small animals.
Homeowners with False Artifacts often report out of place objects, or missing children or pets.

DANGER:
False Artifacts, while not a direct threat to adult humans, can pose a significant risk to small human children and animals.
Should a child or pet be left alone with a False Artifact they are at risk of being encased within.
Once encased, no noise made by the prey can be heard.
While digestion can take upwards of several years to complete, starvation can be a more pressing concern.

SOLUTION:
Once a False Artifact been identified, removal is as simple as physically moving the object out of one's home.
HSH Pest Removal Services should be called to come and remove the object.
Should a pet or loved one already be encased within, one can utilize a Memory Wisp to speed up the griefing process.
