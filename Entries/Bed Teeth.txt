DESCRIPTION:
Bed Teeth are a rare kind of household fungus known for growing in small, cone-like shapes on the underside of bed sheets, blankets, or comforters.
Homeowners infested with Bed Teeth often report mild discomforts when sleeping such as ticking or itching, and more rarely slimy adicic residue on their skin.

DANGER:
Bed Teeth are not directly harmful to most humans, given their brief sleeping schedules.
However, they tend to gradually grow sharper over time if left untreated, which can lead to infections in the open wounds they cause.

SOLUTION:
To prevent the growth of Bed Teeth, bedsheets and blankets should be washed regularly, and inspected for rare, more persistent growths.
Infested covers should be scrubbed thoroughly, or disposed of entirely.
