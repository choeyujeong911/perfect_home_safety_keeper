DESCRIPTION:
Cellar Grottos are large, cave-like networks known to sometimes appear spontaneously in cellars and basements.
Homeowners with Cellar Grottos will often report a bad smell coming from the basement, higher humidity in the home, and a notable increase in large beetles, frogs, and related pests.
[설명]


DANGER:
Cellar Grottos can introduce a number of dangerous pests into the home, and the heightened humidity they introduce can cause warped floorboards, weakened foundation, and other hazards.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
Cellar Grottos can be removed by finding their creator and presenting them with a gift of gold.
Their creator often resides somewhere within the grotto's subterranean lake.
For safety, bring spelunking and snorkeling equipment on your excursion, or consider utilizing HSH's Grotto Removal Team.
