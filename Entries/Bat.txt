DESCRIPTION:
Bats are a general term for a variety of species of nocturnal flying mammals.
Bats can be identified by their usually large ears, wings, and dark fur.
Bats most commonly find their way inside the home during their hibernation period before winter.
Homeowners with a bat infestation will commonly report sounds of scratching or flapping at night and sightings of small dry pellet droppings.

DANGER:
Bats are more dangerous than most household pests given their ability to fly, bite, and spread diseases such as Rabies.
They also commonly have associations with the ones above the soil, increasing the potential danger significantly.
