DESCRIPTION:
Common Hobbs are the most common species of Hobb found in the household.
They are small humanoid creatures with grey, burlap-like skin and small, vertical tufts of hair on their head.
They have no false face.
They are known for their tendency to consume dust, dirt, and common sticky substances found on floors and dishes, cleaning them in the process.
They generally only come out at night.
[설명]


DANGER:
Hobbs are not dangerous to humans on their own.
If provoked, however, they are capable of mischievous acts, and metamorphosis.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
Hobbs cannot be compelled to leave on their own once nested in an home.
Instead, one should take measures to prevent provoking metamorphosis by leaving out a bowl of cream or milk at night.
