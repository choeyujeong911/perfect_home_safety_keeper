DESCRIPTION:
False Beets are creatures with a beet-like appearance that are known to trick gardeners into harvesting and eating them by disguising themselves among their vegetables.
[설명]


DANGER:
False Beets are harmless unless eaten by a human, at which point they will take root in the human's stomach, feeding off its nutrients for its lifetime.
This can cause digestive issues and potential back problems over the course of the human's life.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
False Beets only find themselves in gardens that grow beets.
If you do not wish to contend with False Beet, it is advised to avoid growing beets.
A swallowed False Beet cannot be removed without killing its host.
