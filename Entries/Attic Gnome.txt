DESCRIPTION:

Homeowners infested with Attic Gnomes will often report a knocking or rapping sound coming from their ceilings, or a surplus of dust coming out of their ventilation systems.
[설명]


DANGER:
Attic Gnomes' feeding habits can often be a boon to homeowners, as they consume dust, cobwebs and household pests such as spiders in large quantities.
However, when frightened, they will violently expel their meals which can send large quantities of dust particulates into the air, causing air quality issues in the household.
They are very easily frightened.

SOLUTION:
To remove an Attic Gnome from the household, it is recommended to dust and clean your attics and ceilings regularly, as to avoid giving it a source of food.
This will also prevent other Attic Gnomes from nesting in your home.
