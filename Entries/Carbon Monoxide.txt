DESCRIPTION:
Carbon Monoxide (CO) is an invisible and odorless poisonous gas that is produced whenever a fossil fuel is burned.
CO buildup can be caused by poorly installed/maintained stove and water heater appliances, or a result of poor ventilation.
Homeowners affected by CO poisoning will often report headaches, dizziness, or lethargy.
