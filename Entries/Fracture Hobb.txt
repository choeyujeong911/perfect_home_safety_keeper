DESCRIPTION:
Fracture Hobbs are a subspecies of Hobb that are known to cause cracks and fractures in the walls of the homes they inhabit.
They are physically similar to other Hobbs in stature and size, with the exception of generally longer, wilder hair locs.
They also bear a false face.
[설명]


DANGER:
Fracture Hobbs are not dangerous on their own, but the fratures and cracks they cause can lead to foundational issues in the home.
Like any other Hobb, they are also capable of metamorphosing.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
Fracture Hobbs cannot be removed once they nest.
To prevent further danger, measures to prevent metamorphosis should be taken as soon as possible.
It is advised to leave out a slice of any kind of cheese each night before going to bed.
