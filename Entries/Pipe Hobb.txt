DESCRIPTION:
Pipe Hobbs are a subspecies of Hobb that are known for making homes inside tube-like structures such as pipes.
They bear no false face, and are much smaller than most Hobbs.
They will commonly emerge from their home at night and consume any dirt, grime, and hair in the surrounding area, cleaning it in the process.
[설명]


DANGER:
Pipe Hobbs are not a direct danger to humans, but their physical presence can sometimes cause leaks or clogs over time.
If provoked, they are also capable of mischievous acts, and metamorphosis.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
Pipe Hobbs cannot be compelled to leave on their own once nested.
Instead, one should take measures to prevent provoking metamorphosis by leaving out a clipping of hair near their homes at night.
