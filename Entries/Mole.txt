DESCRIPTION:
Moles are small, dark brown furry mammals with pointed, pink muzzles that are known for living in deep burrows.
Their burrows tend to look like volcano shaped mounds, and they are known to eat insects.

DANGER:
Moles are capable of biting humans and spreading deadly diseases such as rabies, so caution around them is advised.
They also have close relations to the ones beneath the soil, which can cause further danger if provoked.

SOLUTION:
Moles are persistent, and cannot usually be persuaded to leave on their own.
However, Moles can be trapped and removed manually using a variety of common humane mammal traps.
WARNING: NEVER KILL A MOLE.
One can also utilize HSH's Pest Removal Service.
