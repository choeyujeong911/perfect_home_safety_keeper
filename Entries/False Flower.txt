DESCRIPTION:
False Flowers are long, slender creatures that vaguely resemble common house plants.
They are known to take root in indoor potted plants, disguising themselves among the flowers.
Homeowners often report hearing faint singing.
[설명]


DANGER:
False Flowers are harmless if left to their own devices.
However, if homeowners attempt to disrupt or remove them they will often lash out by spraying a toxic chemical known to cause blindness or loss of sight.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
False Flowers are not to be disturbed once they have taken root.
Water regularly, and try not to notice their persence.
Ignore their singing.
