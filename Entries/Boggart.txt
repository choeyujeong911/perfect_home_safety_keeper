DESCRIPTION:
Boggarts is the general term for a metamorphosed Hobb.
They are large, hairy humanoids between 6 to 7 feet tall, and bear fairly convincing false faces.
They are known for causing household accidents such as flooding, fires, or electric outages.
They also frequently observe their targets while they sleep.

DANGER:
Boggarts are extremely dangerous to humans and pets, due to their malicious nightly household activities which can often cause injury or death.
They also react very violently when seen by humans, but thankfully these instances are rare as they excel at staying hidden.

SOLUTION:
Do not under any circumstances refer to an active Boggart by any name.
Once you become aware of its presence, simply vacate the premises.
Provided you do not speak of the Boggart at any time, in any fashion, it will remain in its original location.
