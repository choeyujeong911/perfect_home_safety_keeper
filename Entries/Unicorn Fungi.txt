DESCRIPTION:
Unicorn Fungi are a rare, horn-shaped fungus that are known to grow on the heads of furry mammals and household pets.
They often affect the animals' disposition, causing them to be drawn to the soil.
Homeowners often report their pets furiously digging around or inside their home.

DANGER:
Unicorn Fungi are not directly harmful to humans, but they can often lead to other household problems such as broken floorboards, uprooted plants, or waking up other things beneath the soil.

SOLUTION:
Unicorn Fungi will go away after a few months on its own without treatment, but can also be treated with cryotherapy, or removed surgically, if removal needs expediting.
To prevent Unicorn Fungi from developing, regularly bathe your pet, especially after any outdoor activities.
