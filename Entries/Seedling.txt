DESCRIPTION:
Seedlings are small insectoid creatures about the size of an aphid.
They are known for burrowing in outdoor planters or gardens, feeding off the roots of nearby weeds.
[설명]


DANGER:
Though their weed-killing lifestyles can make them useful for gardeners, Seedlings are extremely territorial and react violently to anything competing for their food source.
** Never remove a weed from a Seedling-infested garden. **
They are known to compel competitors to commit violent acts on themselves or others.
[피해]


SOLUTION:
To remove Seedlings from a garden, one should not go near their established feeding grounds.
Instead, one should use a hose, sprinklers, or similar ranged devices to over-water and drown out the Seedlings from afar.
