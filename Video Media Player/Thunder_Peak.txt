<THE TRAIL>
~ THUNDER PEAK TRAIL ~
Thunder Peak is a straight forward but steep trail, consisting mostly of switchbacks, leading through a natural cave, and finally a short climb up to its pristine peak.
Pace yourself as you progress, This both conserves energy, and helps you appreciate the scenery around you.
Be sure to stop and read the info signs littered along the trail!
When you see red and yellow lines, it means you are in a HIGH ROCKFALL AREA.
Travel with caution.
Once you've entered THE QUIET ZONE, remain completely silent.
As you approach the cave entrance, remove your Hiking Boots.
Enter the cave.
When inside the cave, move carefully and quietly.
Do not stop.
Follow the lights.
Do not stray.
If you hear this sound, stay still and unsheathe your sword.
**a grotesque scream**
**noise**
Once you exit the cave, put on your boots and gloves for the final climb to the peak!
You made it!
Now enjoy the view.
