Subject Line: Notice - Network Errors
From: HSH Corporate

Attention Call Team.
Our Network Team is migrating our backend services over to a new hosting provider this week,
so you may experience some occasional network errors over the next few days.

Please be sure you are studying your information entries carefully while you still have access in case the network goes down while you are on the phone with a client.
You will still be expected to provide accurate answers to our callers regardless of the network's status.

Sincerely,

HSH Corporate
