Subject Line: Introducing our new office pet!
From: HSH Corporate

Hello, Home Safety Hotline family!

We're excited to introduce to all of you our brand new office pet: Whiskers!

Whiskers is loyal, friendly, and it as serious about pest control as we are.
Please give Whiskers a warm welcome if you see him wander by your desk!

NOTE: Please refrain from picking up or feeding Whiskers, as he is still getting to know everyone in the office, and has scheduled feeding times.

Sincerely,

HSH Corporate
