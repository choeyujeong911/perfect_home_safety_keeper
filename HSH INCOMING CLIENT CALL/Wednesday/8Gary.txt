Do you think this is some kind of joke?
Last week I called you guys about some weird noises I had coming from my living room, and the info package you sent me said something about leaving out a bowl of cream?
What kind of joke is that?
It's been a week now that I've been dealing with this racket, no thanks to you, and now we're starting to have power outages!
Your employees' stupid joke is now probably gonna cost me who know how much in repair costs, so talk to your manager and tell them they owe me big time!
You figure out what's going on in my house and you figure it out NOW!
