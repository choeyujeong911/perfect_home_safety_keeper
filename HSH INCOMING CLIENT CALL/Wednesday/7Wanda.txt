Hello.
I was told to call this number to ask about my problem.
The wall in my bedroom doesn't look right near the bottom.
The bottom of the wall has some cracks, or maybe it's peeling?
I'm not sure.
I have a cat named Whiskers, and sometimes he likes to sharpen his claws on the couch, but he would never do that to the wall, he knows just how naughty that would be.
