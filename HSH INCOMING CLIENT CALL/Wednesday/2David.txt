THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE BASEMENT!
I've seen it!
It's huge, almost as big as my dog.
It doesn't hiss or growl or anything but I haven't gotten close enough to it to find out what it is since it's always lurking just out of sight from the top of the stairs.
I need someone to come get this thing out of my basement as soon as possible!
I've locked the door since I can still hear the steps creaking under its weight down there.
