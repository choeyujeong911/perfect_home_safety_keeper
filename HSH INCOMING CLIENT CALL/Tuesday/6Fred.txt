Yeah, hey.
I'm calling about a noise I've been hearing in my house lately.
Sounds like scratching or something, it's real quiet, but there's definitely some kinda pest in my walls.
I've set out all kinds of traps and I thought one worked for a while but then I started hearing it again this week.
I thankfully haven't seen any visible damage yet or droppings or whatever.
