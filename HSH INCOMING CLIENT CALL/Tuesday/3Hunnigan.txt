CURRENT CALLER: HUNNIGAN
Transcription:

Do you know if there's such a thing as house thieves that clean?
Like, maybe to disguise the robbery?
At night I keep hearing all this noise coming from my living room, but when I go to look at it I find the place spotless, but haven't yet found anything missing.
I've talked with the cop, but they keep telling me to call this number, so here I am.
Is there something you can do?
