This might, like, sound strange, but I think there's some kind of, like, squid or something in my bathroom!
Like, I went into the bathroom in the middle of the night last night, you know?
And I could see something slithering under near the sink with its like, uh, little tendracles or, like, tendrils or, you know, whatever, but when I turned on the lights nothing was there.
I checked under the towel, like, under, you know, like that little soap thing, and everything, but I know it's somewhere!
Like, it's too freaking big to have gone down the drain, so it's still gotta be hiding in here.
