Transcription:

Hey, called last week about some noises in my house and after following the instructions you sent me, they still seem to be happening.
I already told you guys what was happening but uh, the short story is that every night I'm hearing clattering noises coming from the kitchen>
In the morning I usually check the kitchen for any signs of droppings or whatever, but the place looks spotless.
Can you tell me what's actually happening so I can get some sleep?
