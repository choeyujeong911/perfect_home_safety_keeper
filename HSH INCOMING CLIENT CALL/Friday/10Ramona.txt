CURRENT CALLER: RAMONA
Transcription:

I think some homeless or druggies might be in my house, because I keep finding used needles, cans, metal scrap and other such nasty things on my living room carpet!
I have children in this house and this is a very serious hazard to their health!
And before you say anything, yes I already called the police and they told me to call this number instead, so I assume you will send over the proper authorities to deal with this matter promptly.
