There's some kind of INSECT in my house and I think it may have died??
I saw this big nasty thing fly in through the window and I haven't been able to find it anywhere, but I think maybe it electrocuted itself somewhere because I can smell this awful burning scent throughout the house!
Can someone come find this thing and get it out my house?
