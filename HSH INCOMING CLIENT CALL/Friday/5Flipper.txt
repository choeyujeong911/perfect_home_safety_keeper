Hey, Flipper here.
I've got two dumbbells that I bought from you that need a good spit-shine, know what I mean?
I mean these bells have got all kinds of grit, grime, grease, I can't even see my face in 'em when I'm dead-lifting, know what I mean?
I mean I'm looking at these bells right now, ya hear?
I'm seein' spit, crud, juice
Hey, who are you?
How did you get in??
Hey, now easy there.
Get away! Get away! ... <Squeaking>
