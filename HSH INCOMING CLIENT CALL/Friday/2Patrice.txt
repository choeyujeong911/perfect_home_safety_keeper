There were Satan worshippers in my shed!
I think it might be my no-good teenager having joined up with one of those "Dungeon Dragon" cults they say these days, because he's been gone for days now and the next thing you know I find a dang tree growing in my shed!
The tree is all covered in torn up fabric and some kind of black liquid, classic Satanic ritual crap I assume.
Tell me what I can do to get these godless teens off my property!
