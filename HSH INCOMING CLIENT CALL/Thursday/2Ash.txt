Transcription:

I think there might be something wrong with our faucet.
Recently I've been having the worst kind of stomach bug, just aches and pains constantly.
But after a month it still hasn't gone away and I'm thinking there's gotta be something wrong with the water because we only eat fresh, home grown fruits and vegetables here and we've never had any problems up until now.
I keep hearing things about rusty pipes and water poisoning and all kinds of terrible things that can happen to the water so can you send someone out to get this fixed for us?
