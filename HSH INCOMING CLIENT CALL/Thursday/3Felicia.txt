CURRENT CALLER: FELICIA
Transcription:

The police told me to call this number, so I uh, hope I got the right number here.
Anyway uh... I think... I think someboby is stalking me.
I can see their shadow at night at my window, just staring into the house.
When I close the window I can still hear him out there, breathing.
I've been sleeping on the couch every night this past week just so he won't see me.
The police said they can't do anything so please, send somebody or do something about this.
I can hardly sleep anymore.

Button: PUT ON HOLD
