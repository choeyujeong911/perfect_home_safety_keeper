CURRENT CALLER: PHIL
Transcription:

Hey.. so my doctor told me I should call this number?
I have no idea why, he won't tell me anything.
He said you could help so here goes nothing I guess.
Uhh... so I've recently been having just the worst headaches, and just barely I woke up and found my eyes were starting to look kinda pink?
I'm really freaked out right now, and I'm not sure what I have, I can't find anything online.
Can you help me?
