Hi.
I'm concerned somewhat about the stability of my new home.
I recently finalized the purchase and naturally afterwards found that there are several large cracks in the walls of the basement that were not previously disclosed, as well as several pieces of half-eaten cheese littered across the basement floor?
I haven't been able to get in contact with the previous owners about this and am wondering if you can offer any kind of legal advice?
