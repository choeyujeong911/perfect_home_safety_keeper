Please help me!!
The police refused to do anything, they told me to call you!!
Oh please, say you can help.
My little Jeremy has gone missing!!
He's eight years old, and such a sweetheart.
The last time I saw him was when I was tucking him into bed last night and checking his messy closet for bees to calm him down.
Oh it's silly, I know.
My poor Jeremy is always so concerned about bees and wasps and such.
I miss him so much!
Oh please say you can help me find him, he's all that I have!
