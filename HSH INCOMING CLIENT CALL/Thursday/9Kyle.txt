You gotta tell me what's going on inside my home, okay, I'm freaking out over here.
There's holes all over my freakin' house man.
Freakin' HOLES.
I'm stepping around big wooden splinters, there's no telling how much damage there is.
I've got this big gaping one in my kitchen, and I have no idea how freakin' deep it goes.
To top it all off my skittish little greyhound, Goblin, is nowhere to be found.
She probably took off after seeing this mess.
I need help, bad.
