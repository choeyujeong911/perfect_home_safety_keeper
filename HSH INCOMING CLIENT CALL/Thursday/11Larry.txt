There's something....
There's something in my basement.
I don't know what it is, all I know is when I open my basement door, it smells like a damn sewer and I can hear it making all kinds of horrible noises.
It sounds like there might be a lot of water down there too, I don't know what it might be doing down there, but I have a feeling it's causing a whole lot of damage.
Please, send somebody to help with this, I can't deal with something like this!
