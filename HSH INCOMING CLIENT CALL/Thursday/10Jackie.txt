Alright I'm gonna need someone to explain what in the name of Christmas is happening to my living room.
I'm back from vacation and the house is already turning into a disaster not 24 hours later.
My living room is absolutely covered in soil and plants, looks like a gosh darn nursery in there.
What is happening?
Is this what happens when you buy a bad rug of something?
