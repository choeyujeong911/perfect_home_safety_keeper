CURRENT CALLER: SHEILA
Transcription:

Hello, I saw your commercial and thought I would call just in case you might know what's going on.
I was recently putting my kettle on for a bit of afternoon Earl Grey, when I heard this awful buzzing sound coming from the cupboard.
I looked around inside but I couldn't find anything but a few loose tea leaves!
I'm quite concerned about hornets and bees and the like because I'm quite allergic to their stings, so I just wanted to know if there's anything I should be worried about right now.
My hearing isn't what it used to be after all.
