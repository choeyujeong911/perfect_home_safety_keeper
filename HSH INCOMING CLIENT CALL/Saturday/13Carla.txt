So uh...
I've been hearing this weird sound coming from the walls.
I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I've been having a hard time sleeping at night because of this sound.
<indiscernable>
Can you hear that?
It's been non stop lately.
I've replaced all of my smoke detector batteries and everything but I cannot figure out where this sound is coming from.
