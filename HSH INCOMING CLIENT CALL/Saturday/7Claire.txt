Hey yeah there's this awful smell of rotten eggs coming from my dining room and when I looked to see what it was I saw this awful, disgusting pile of crap on my dinner table!
It's quite big too, which has me worried that whatever produced this might still be in the house, because who knows how big this thing is!
My dof can't even lay something down that big!
