I think some pranksters might be giving my wife and I a run for our money.
Lately my wife's clothes have started going missing, and at night I keep hearing this strange whoopie cushion type sound coming from outside.
I've tried to scare the kids off by keeping the porch lights on at night and putting out a neighborhood watch sign but I think they're on to my tricks.
Do you have any advice you can send me?
