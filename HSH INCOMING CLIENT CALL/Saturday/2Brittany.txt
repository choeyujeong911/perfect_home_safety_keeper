CURRENT CALLER: BRITTANY
Transcription:

Some kind of animal has gotten into my cellar!
I know it's down there 'cause I can hear it flapping around sometimes when the house is quiet.
Tell me what to do to get rid of this thing because I think it's getting into all my Pinot Noirs and Chardonnays!
I found a whole bunch of broken bottles on the floor.
Stupid thing is probably getting loaded.
