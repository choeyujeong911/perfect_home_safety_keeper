Okay, you wanna explain to me what the hell is happening?
I called last week to ask about why my home's heater has been having issues, and nothing's changed after following the instructions you sent me.
Shut up!
I know your teeth hurt, but daddy is on the phone right now!
Anyway, we're still freezing our butts off over here, so tell me what the hell is happening right now so I can get this fixed properly.
