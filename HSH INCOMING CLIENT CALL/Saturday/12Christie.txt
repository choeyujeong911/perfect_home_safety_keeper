CURRENT CALLER: CHRISTIE
Transcription:

Hi, we need some medical help.
I'm not exactly sure what to say since I talked to our family practitioner already but he said to call here so, um, we've been having trouble sleeping.
I thought it was just me but both my husband and I started feeling shortness of breath around the same time.
I'm worried about something spreading throughout our house since our kids all have asthma and some particularly severe allergies.
We tried washing all the bed sheets in the house but that didn't really help much.
Thankfully, the kids haven't had any issues yet so could you help us out sooner than later?
