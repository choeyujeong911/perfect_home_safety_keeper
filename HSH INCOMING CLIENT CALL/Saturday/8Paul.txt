Heyya, yeah Paul here.
I'm not sure what to do anymore.
My kids can't sleep at night!
I been sprain' about fifty kinds of pesticides all over the place, washed and scrubbed all the bedsheets as much as freakin' possible, and every night it's the same story.
A bunch of itchy kids with nightmares waking up at 4am and beggin' to sleep in Papa's bed.
I'm fresh out of ideas.
