CURRENT CALLER: HOWARD
Transcription:

I think there's someone watching me.
Outside, something is moving around the threes and I can never get a good look at them but I know they're out there.
I've seen their eyes.
I don't know who they are but the police were no help, they just asked me stupid questions like if I mowed my lawn recently or if I ate fruit in public of something and then told me to call you.
I'm hoping you'll be more helpful.
