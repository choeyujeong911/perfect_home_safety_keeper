Hey do you guys have a lawn mowing service or something?
My good-for-nothing kid refuses to mow, and it's getting real crazy out there.
Looking like a rainforest over here.
My kid is complaining about being too sick to do anything about it, blah blah blah.
The stress of this stupid lawn is giving me a headache just thinking about it.
Can you send some guys up to get this done?
