Hank here.
Last week I called your guys about some crap in my yard, and I was told it wasn't anything to worry about.
Well guess what?
There's more piles of crap in my yard!
I'm talking huge piles of brown out there.
You better not tell me it's nothing again, because I know I've seen something moving out there.
Tell me what it is so I can take care of it once and for all.
