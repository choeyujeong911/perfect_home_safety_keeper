CURRENT CALLER: CAROL
Transcription:

Welcome to Home Safety Hotline, new employee.
My name is Carol, and I'll be acting as your Supervisor during your time here at HSH.
Before your begin your first day here, let me tell you a bit about how things work here.
You are an HSH Responder, as such it is your job to learn about various household hazards so you can answer the questions of our callers intelligently.
When a client calls, answer the call and listen carefully to their concerns.
When you've diagnosed their issue, submit the corresponding Household Hazard, and we'll forward them safety instructions to address their problem.
Welcome to the HSH family.
I'm sure we'll talk again soon.
