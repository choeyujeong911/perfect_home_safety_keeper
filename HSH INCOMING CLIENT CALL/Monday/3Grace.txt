CURRENT CALLER: GRACE
Transcription:

Hi!
I'm so sorry, my name is Grace and it's probably nothing but I thought I'd call just in case.
Lately I can't sleep at night because of this annoying little sound coming from my attic.
It sounds kind of like <indiscernable>.
It's probably nothing.
I'm sure it could just be regular old house noises but I just thought I'd call to ask and make sure.
